*** THERMAL AND POWER ANALYSIS ***
Temperature Analysis:
  Maximum Temperature: 255 units
  STATUS: THERMAL STRESS DETECTED!
  This likely triggered CRITICAL power state (6)
Power Analysis:
  Maximum Power: 185 units
  Minimum Power: 3 units
  Power Range: 182 units
  STATUS: High power consumption detected.
  This may have contributed to CRITICAL power state.
Emergency Response:
  CRITICAL MODE ACTIVE: Emergency power reduction engaged.
  It detected dangerous conditions and responded appropriately.
Energy Efficiency:
  Energy Savings: 65520 units (perhaps too high, I might have miscalculated...?).
